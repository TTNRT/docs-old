A quick walkthrough on our page making

## Headers

Headers use the `#` for doing that for markdown.

Examples:

```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

## Paragraph

Paragraphs don't use the `<p>` tag. In fact, they are considered texts from that.

## Code Block

We sometimes use the code blocks for source code or examples.

Example:

`Code line`

```
Code block
```

## Quotes

Doing quotes is sometimes needed for SRC on image files or general text credits

## Numbering

Numbering down sections or listing them is a needed step if doing a tutorial page. Because the bullet points are sometimes needed, they are the same thing, but for different reasons (see below).

### Points

Bullet points usually don't mean anything, but they can infer required things such as cords, devices, and mass storage devices. We may also this for other purposes soon.

## Tables

Tables are a good idea for sorting and comparing. For a page, it uses the same method for doing the title and layout options. This is hidden, but this example is always visible to the public.

```
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Text     | Text     | Text     |
```

## Links

Links are used for citations (mainly for wikis) to source that section directly. In fact, wikis use that, but we sometimes put references to the table.

## Other

Other styles for paragraphs are not needed, but they can help the reader on what the page is talking about.

### Bolded

Bolded text means that it is an important part you should remember.

### Italic

This type is most likely used for definitions and underlines.

### Underlines

We can do underlines as well in markdown. There is no symbol for that, so we use the `<u>` tag for that. This section will refer to the [bolded](#bolded) part of this page.

### Strikethrough

This one is mainly needed only for the deletion of text that is either misspelled or just not typed out correctly. This is useful for wikis as well.

### Alerts

Alerts are used as a reminder or warning (depending on the section) and is using both Bootstrap and their icons. However, some pages use this as a template and do not use any html inside of the file.

## Summery

In general, the syntax is somewhat complex, and it really is for doing these. These help us save time with writing HTML or other. You can find out the rest we might use on the example page.
