A quick walkthrough on our page making

## Headers

Headers use the `#` for doing that for markdown.

Examples:

```
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

## Paragraph

Paragraph don't use the `<p>` tag. In fact, they are considerd text from that.

## Code Block

We sometimes use the code blocks for source code or examples.

Example:

`Code line`

```
Code block
```

## Quotes

Doing quotes is sometimes needed for SRC on image files or general text credits

## Numbering

Numbering down sections or listing them is a needed step if doing a tutorial page. Because the bullet points are sometime needed, they are the same thing, but for different reasons (see below this).

### Points

Bullet points usually don't mean anything, but they can infer on required things such as cords, devices, and mass storage devices. We may also this for other purposes soon.

## Tables

Tables are a good idea for sorting and comparing. For a page, it uses the same method for doing the title and layout options. This is hidden, but this example is always visable for the public.

```
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Text     | Text     | Text     |
```

## Links

Links are used for citations (mainly for wikis) to source that section directly. In face, wikis use that, but we sometimes put references to the table.

## Other

Other styles for paragrahs are not needed almost, but they can help the reader on what the page is talking about.

### Bolded

Bolded text means that it is a importent part you should remember.

### Italic

This type is most likey used for defenitions and underlines.

### Underlines

We can do underlines as well in markdown. There is not symbol for that, so we use the `<u>` tag for that. This section will refer to the [bolded](#bolded) part of this page.

### Strikethrough

This one is mainly needed only for deletion of text is either missspelled or just not typed out right. This is useful for wiki's as well.

## Summery

In general, the syntex is somewhat complex, and it really is for doing these. These help us save time with writing html or other. You find out the rest we might use in the example page.
